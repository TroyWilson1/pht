# pht - Personal Hash Tracker (IPFS)

This is a little script to help me track all the new items that I add to IPFS. This **only** stores a few things including hash, description, url if you loaded it from the web. This is all stored in a local JSON file that you can query at a later date to find the hashes you have stored. 

## Usage

```
~$pht
What do you want to do?
 a)Add a new IPFS hash
 s)Seach stored hashes
 d)Delete stored hashes
 q)Quit
  >>
```
