# pht - Personal Hash Tracker (IPFS)

This is a little script to help track all the new items that I add to IPFS. This *only* stores a hash and description that you give it in a local JSON file that you can query at a later date to find the hashes you have stored. 

Any help in cleaning up code or adding additional features is always a great help.  

##Usage

```
What do you want to do?
 a)Add a new IPFS hash
 s)Seach stored hashes
 d)Delete stored hashes - Not done yet
  >>
```
